What a title huh? I figured that is how one starts a blog post. Get the readers attention etc. etc.

I am assuming you have no clue what RSS is. If you do; [here is my feed!](https://fynnfr.org/blog/index.xml)

If you do not, here is a small intro:

## What is RSS (Really Simple Syndication)?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a user-controlled way to follow online content, fundamentally different from modern social media platforms and email newsletters. Think of it as a decentralized news feed without ads, algorithmic manipulation, or corporate control.

Unlike email newsletters where you share your address with publishers (risking spam and data selling), RSS follows a "pull" rather than "push" model. An RSS feed is simply a text file on a website containing chronological posts, similar to a traditional newspaper format.

You choose an RSS reader application--there are many options available with a good few being open source--which then retrieves content only from the feeds you explicitly subscribe to.
The websites can not push content to you; you control what you see.

While RSS was widely popular about 15 years ago, many users switched to commercial social media platforms.

However, there's renewed interest in returning to this simpler, more user-controlled system (well, according to [^2]; can't really see a spike in google trends; prob just a vibe the orginal author is getting from their bubble. However, it should definitely make a bigger comeback. Doubt it will happen though). A similar technology called Atom exists alongside RSS, and modern reader apps support both formats.[^1]

## Why should you use it?

Did this not do the trick already?
