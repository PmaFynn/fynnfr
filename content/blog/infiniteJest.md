*no hard spoilers until otherwise stated*

One of the, if not the most humbling reading experience I have ever had.
However, before I go into detail as to what and why the book humbled me it is
essential to express that the book--even without my complete understanding of it (This helped a lot [^1]);
not being able to properly work out the complete unwritten ending on my own
which Wallace describes as the book having failed one [^2]--is absolutly
amazing. I was thinking of rereading the book again the second I finished
it but decided against it due to my exams coming up which would properly
stretch out the time required for the full reread. Furthermore, I only found
DFW's quote (first footnote) after having decided not to tackle the puzzle
myself and just look it up [^3]. I regret having taken this step a lot (!) as I do
not think I was that far away from working it out myself (Edit: Well, at least to the complete solution I was also not really close lol). However, working it
out would have required rereading the entire thing. I will still reread the
book 100%--just not this upcoming year.

[^2]: Herb: Is there no “ending” to “Infinite Book” because there couldn’t be? Or did you just get tired of writing it?

    DFW: There is an ending as far as I’m concerned. Certain kind of parallel lines are supposed to start converging in such a way that an “end” can be projected by the reader somewhere beyond the right frame. If no such convergence or projection occurred to you, then the book’s failed for you.
