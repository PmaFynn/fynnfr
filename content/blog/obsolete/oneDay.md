Decent at best. The acting was good—at least, I suppose so—but it couldn’t save the series. I haven’t read the book or watched the earlier movie adaptation of the same story, so I can’t judge it in relation to those works. The middle part of the series felt really slow and somewhat unnecessary. The main character being a dick was well-established in the first episode, so there was no need to stretch that across 7–10 episodes.

I might watch the movie at some point, as I think a shorter version would work significantly better. The last two episodes stood out, thanks to Woodall’s great performance. Overall, the story provides some food for thought, but that credit belongs to David Nicholls’ original book rather than the series. 

I would hardly recommend it.

Finally, referring to a 14 episode series as a mini-series is a debatable decision (I am aware that every series that finishes in one season is being refered to as such by Netflix but I, nonethelessstill , do not like it).
