Really enjoyed this one. Tbh, I did not know this album prior to watching the movie. Never actually heard of it. I own it now.

> "You always have to ask who wrote it and are they still living, you know. In case they maybe here, they come down. You get them to come down. More people, you know, have died, but so many are left. So, we always want to try to find those people. You know, they might be down the street. They might be here. Who knows? They might be around the corner. You never know."
