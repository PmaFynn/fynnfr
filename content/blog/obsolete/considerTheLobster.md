Tbh, I expected something different. Something more like "This is water" (brilliant btw). However, the article was thought-provoking nonetheless.

I do not think I have ever eaten lobster before which, I am now quite certain, will not change.

Wallace's feelings regarding tourism in general resonated with me quite deeply.

Overall, I will hardly recommend this article/essay to people even though it would deserve a recommendation. I just do not want to get into a discussion about such a topic--I would probably benefit (long-term) from asking myself why I do not want that conversation but the trick is to just ignore it; not as uncomfortable.
