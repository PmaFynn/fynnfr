Why did I watch it? Good question, in hindsight I should'nt have (no recommendation). 

The reason I watched the series is that I read a comment (just a reddit comment iirc) that mentioned the series and how it is *actually* funny...Yeah, thats it. For some reason I did not question the authority of that comment and just put it on my watchlist and shortly after decided to watch it (I hate not finishing series once I started them (excl. sitcoms, I never finished one ever) even though I do not enjoy them). 

Nothing much to say about the series itself. Personally, it didnt give me much. Spend no thought on it after finishing it.
