Honestly, while it was good--really good; I expected something entirely different. I found this movie by scrolling through IMDb's top movie selection and read the synopsis which led me to believe, for only god knows what reason, that I was in store for something similiar to 'Seven'; I did not see the release date. Should I have seen the date initially I would have known I would be in for a different kind of treat. A movie where the focus is the dialoge. Kind of similar to '12 Angry Men'. Both wholeheartly enjoyable. Nonetheless I would have probably choosen a different time to watch this since, as mentioned before, I was expecting and prepared for something different. It was rather late, I was tired and would have prefered to just shut down and get entertained by a movie without doing any of the thinking required for the movie to become the masterpiece that it is.
