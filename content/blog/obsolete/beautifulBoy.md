Mixed feeling about this one. While not a bad movie it could have done more I think; perhaps a more lengthy directors cut, idk, felt rushed sometimes. It focued more on the family of the addict instead of the addicts themselves which is nice but the motivations of the addict himself felt empty, not explored, at least past the halfway point of the movie. While I have not taken any hard drugs and can hardly evaluate the proper display of motivations and emotions involved this is just what it felt like too me. 

Moreover, the movie highlights how little a less well off family is able to help their child fighting such an addiction; they can hardly just travel accross the states multiple times to pick it up for example.
Well, I did not enjoy it enough to give more thoughts to it.
