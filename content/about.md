I'm Fynn.

My interests are software (i.e. FOSS), literature and, at least currently, western esotericism.

Why am I writing this in english you may ask. Well, I just prefer english. I think it is a more fine and musical language. That is all there is to it.

I have no clue what else to put here. Though, I can recommend some software.

### Software I use *and* recommend:
For my operating system, I rely on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/),
paired with [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) as my shell, enhanced by
[*oh my zsh*](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). My terminal of choice
is [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).
For web browsing, I use
[Floorp](https://floorp.app/en) and, as far as it is possible right now, [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org) with
[Kagi](https://kagi.com/) as my preferred search engine.

Browsing without the following extensions is, however, virutally impossible:
- [**uBlock origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/)
- [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)
- [SponsorBlock for Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)
- [Unhook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos)

For
text editing, I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with my fork of
[*kickstart*](https://github.com/PmaFynn/kickstart-mod.nvim). My window
manager is [i3](https://i3wm.org/), and I manage files with
[Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi). I keep up with news using
[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) as my RSS reader, and view documents
with [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/). For presentations, I
utilize a combination of the following tools:
- [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)
- [LaTeX beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer)
- [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)

My favourite packages/tools are:
dmenu, rclone, pass, neovim, Ghostty, raindrop, newsboat.

Some general preferences of mine include using Vim bindings wherever possible and binding Caps Lock to
Ctrl.

## On a different note:

Buying stuff, huh? Great, is it not? Not really.
However, there are a few items I genuinely don't regret buying:
- flyscreen
- ergonomic keyboard
- shopping trolley
- most books
- most second hand clothing
- second hand ThinkPad
- comfortable slippers
