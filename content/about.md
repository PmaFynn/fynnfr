I'm Fynn. 

My interests are software, literature and, at least currenlty, western esotericism...

I have no clue what else to put here. Though, I can recommend some software.

## Software I use *and* recommend:
For my operating system, I rely on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/),
paired with [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) as my shell, enhanced by
[*oh my zsh*](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). My terminal of choice
is [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) though I am also trying out [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).
For web browsing, I use
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) configured with
[BetterFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox) user.js, and
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as my preferred search engine.

Browsing without the following extensions is, however, virutally impossible:
- [**uBlock
origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [I still don't care about
cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/)
- [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)
- [SponsorBlock for
Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)

For
text editing, I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with my fork of
[*kickstart*](https://github.com/PmaFynn/kickstart-mod.nvim). My window
manager is [i3](https://i3wm.org/), and I manage files with
[Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi). I keep up with news using
[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) as my RSS reader, and view documents
with [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/).For presentations, I
utilize a combination of the following tools:
- [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)
- [LaTeX beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer)
- [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)

My favourite packages/tools are:
dmenu, rclone, pass, neovim, tmux, buku.

## General preferences

Some general preferences include using Vim bindings wherever possible and binding Caps Lock to
Ctrl.

## Stuff I am currently excited about:
Currently, I'm
particularly excited about [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org/).

## Purchases I do not regret

There are a few items I genuinely don't regret buying: 
- flyscreen (5 euro)
- ergonomic keyboard (worthwhile if you type extensively)
- shopping trolley
- most books

## Purchases I did not regret

Well, tbh, I regret most of my purchases and I am not even buying much.

- ergonomic keyboard (only if you actually type a lot obv.)

- shopping trolley

Damn, that is even less than I expected. Well, there you go. Prob gonna update this continually.
